Most of the data-structure examples available across internet are either in C, C++ or Java.
For developers like me, it turns out to be a barrier in data-structure comprehension.
C programs are not hard to comprehend, but it gets tricky with pointers, and memory allocations.
For C++ and Java, one needs to understand the language and its syntax clearly to understand the examples.

Last time, I used C, C++, was in my college days and Java, I guess in 2010.
Interviews in those days mainly focused on language, tools and day-to-day practical use cases.
Nowadays, data-structure and algorithm is one of the core part of interview.

Front-End development is no longer restricted to DOM scripting and DHTML, but full-fledged client side rich interactive applications.
Knowledge on data-structure and algorithm is highly necessary.
For example, knowledge of tree traversal, is required for efficient DOM traversal and manipulation.

Front-End developers like me, comprehends JavaScript much better than any other programming language.
The purpose of this repository is to serves as a data-structure guide/reference for folks with JavaScript background.
